1. Dataset Generator Program

   This section contains only one program: (1.1) dataset_eng.py. It is a dataset generator used to generate custom datasets.

2. ChatGLM Program

   This section consists of four programs: (2.1) cover_alpaca2jsonl.py, which converts json to jsonl; (2.2) tokenize_dataset_rows.py, which tokenizes data using a tokenizer; (2.3) Fine_tune_glm.py, which fine-tunes the ChatGLM model; and (2.4) web_glm.py, which displays the Q&A performance of the ChatGLM model.

3. GPT-2 Program

   This section comprises three programs: (3.1) download_gpt2.py, which downloads the GPT-2 model locally; (3.2) Fine_tune_gpt2.py, which fine-tunes the GPT-2 model; and (3.3) web_gpt2.py, which showcases the Q&A performance of the GPT-2 model.
